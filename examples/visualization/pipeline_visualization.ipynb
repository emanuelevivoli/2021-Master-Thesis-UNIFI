      "['With the advances in e-Sciences and the growing complexity of scientific analyses, more and more scientists and researchers are relying on workflow systems for process coordination, derivation automation, provenance tracking, and bookkeeping. While workflow systems have been in use for decades, it is unclear whether scientific workflows can or even should build on existing workflow technologies, or they require fundamentally new approaches. In this paper, we analyze the status and challenges of scientific workflows, investigate both existing technologies and emerging languages, platforms and systems, and identify the key challenges that must be addressed by workflow systems for e-science in the 21st century.', 'The conventional approaches to routing and bandwidth allocation, the two major components of traffic engineering, have proved insufficient to address QoS requirements of flows while optimizing utilization for complex communication networks. In this paper we consider ant colony algorithms to address this problem. Our studies show that the ant-based routing models are sensitive to initial parameters settings. Only careful adjustments of these initial parameters results in an acceptable convergence behavior. The robust behavior of the real ant compared to the routing algorithms derived from it inspires us to investigate the reasons behind the shortcomings of these algorithms. We present results from an in-depth study of ant behavior in a quest for a robust algorithm. In this work we consider a realistic environment in which multiple source-destination flows compete for resources. We study the routing and load balancing behavior that emerges and show how the behavior relates to analytical approaches. We show the results using simulations in OPNET and derive recommendations on the improvement of the ant-like algorithms', 'Coase (Journal of Low and Economics 17(2):185-213, 1974) failed to appreciate that the construction and maintenance of nineteenth-century lighthouses were in part financed by British taxpayers.

While agreeing with Bertrand’s conclusion, we dispute her reasoning and argue that lighthouses nevertheless could have been supplied by the private sector.', \"Abstract Drawing on the perspectives of interfirm governance mechanisms, we develop a contingency theoretical framework that examines how contract specificity and trust interact with local suppliers' physical asset specificity and human asset specificity in shaping the relationship performance of offshore cooperation between local suppliers and global buyers. The empirical data for hypothesis testing were collected from a survey of 162 dyads composed of Chinese local suppliers and international buyers. The empirical results reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between physical asset specificity and relationship performance, and this inverted U-shaped relationship is stronger when the level of contract specificity is higher. There is a linear and positive relationship between human asset specificity and relationship performance, and this relationship becomes stronger when the level of trust between the local supplier and international buyer is higher.\", 'In this paper I discuss some constraints and implications in accessing fellow academics as research participants, a topic that has rarely been addressed thus far in the literature.

By referencing my personal experience of engaging with Chinese academics, I will then discuss the role of personal contacts in research and reflect upon various constraints in accessing fellow academics as research participants.

Established methods exist for measuring human physical and performance characteristics but the identification of requirements has received little attention as yet. It is anticipated that progress, which has largely been confined to the area of consumer ergonomics, will accelerate once the connection between poorly designed products and subsequent costly incapacity in the population is more widely recognized. User requirements can provide a clear, testable basis for product development and evaluation when expressed as performance specifications. Problems which may be encountered in the identification of user requirements may be avoided by establishing the patterns of activity prior to discussing the underlying requirements with the user.', 'Present study has assessed the farm household condition in two climatically vulnerable districts of Odisha. Balasore and Khurda districts are vulnerable to cyclone & flood and drought & heat-wave, respectively. Farm families of Khurda district have a better socio-personal and socio-economic profile as compared to Balasore district; however, farmers of Balasore district are having better exposure to cosmopolite information sources than Khurda district thus carry better knowledge level on climate change. The lives of inhabitants are most at risk from cyclone and flood than from drought and heat wave. Poor are the worst affected. Not only they are worst hit, but also their capacity to recover from a disaster is relatively low. Any extreme situation traps the poor in a situation to sell off productive assets that become difficult to retrieve and thereby reinforcing the poverty almost permanently.', 'Trust is a critical component of competency committees given their high-stakes decisions. Research from outside of medicine on group trust has not focused on trust in group decisions, and “group trust” has not been clearly defined. The purpose was twofold: to examine the definition of trust in the context of group decisions and to explore what factors may influence trust from the perspective of those who rely on competency committees through a proposed group trust model. The authors conducted a literature search of four online databases, seeking articles published on trust in group settings. Reviewers extracted, coded, and analyzed key data including definitions of trust and factors pertaining to group trust. The authors selected 42 articles for full text review. Although reviewers found multiple general definitions of trust, they were unable to find a clear definition of group trust and propose the following: a group-directed willingness to accept vulnerability to actions of the members based on the expectation that members will perform a particular action important to the group, encompassing social exchange, collective perceptions, and interpersonal trust. Additionally, the authors propose a model encompassing individual level factors (trustor and trustee), interpersonal interactions, group level factors (structure and processes), and environmental factors. Higher degrees of trust at the individual and group levels have been associated with attitudinal and performance outcomes, such as quality of group decisions. Developing a deeper understanding of trust in competency committees may help these committees implement more effective and meaningful processes to make collective decisions.', 'lines\".

A short overview of the on-going upgrade program will be given.', 'The site preference of Ir, the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and the low-temperature specific heat of β-Mn1−xIrx alloys have been investigated. In Mn1−xIrx alloys, the β-phase exists below x = 0.102. From x-ray diffraction patterns, almost all Ir atoms are substituted at site 1 in the β-Mn lattice. The electronic specific heat coefficient γ is proportional to the Neel temperature TN in the form TN3/4 in regions of low-Ir concentration. With increasing x, however, the gradual decrease in γ leads to a relative increase in γ from the straight line. Therefore, it is concluded that the magnetic state of the β-Mn1−xIrx alloys varies from a weak itinerant-electron antiferromagnet to an intermediate antiferromagnet with increasing Ir concentration. The point to observe is that the γ versus TN3/4 plots give a universal line for all the β-Mn alloy systems over the entire concentration range.', 'The magnitude of heat flux of sunshine through glass used in the building industry is examined.

For OCVD transients of poly (3-hexylthiophene-2, 5-diyl) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) solar cells, we observe that the open circuit voltage as a function time t changes from initially being nearly constant to being proportional to ln(t) for most part of the decay before eventually decaying to zero. We demonstrate that the transients can be fully described over eight orders of magnitude in time using a simple model of decay based on a diode coupled to a capacitor. The fitting to the analytical model solution enables true determination of the diode ideality factor and saturation leakage current. The ideality factor is observed to vary between 1.52 and 1.68 depending on excess carrier concentration and temperature. The technique is used to isolate the diode current in presence of excess carriers, and hence to independently determine t...', \"The evolution of supernova remnants (SRN's) is followed numerically taking into account the non-linear effects of particle acceleration in shock waves.

It is concluded that the observed higher frequency wiggles in atmospheric 14C/12C ratios occurring with time scales of about two hundred years and of 1 to 2 percent in magnitude (de Vries, 1958; Suess, 1970a,b; 1979; Damon, Lerman, and Long, 1978), are largely due to solar activity dependent modulation of the galactic cosmic ray flux by solar plasma.

The results from numerous reports indicate that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) inhibits platelet aggregation in vitro, but there are few studies on its action in vivo. Since an agent that inhibits platelet aggregation should not be used as a diluent in experiments that test antiaggregatory activity of other agents, DMSO was tested in dogs with partially constricted coronary arteries to evaluate its effect on platelet aggregation in vivo.', 'Abstract Serially cultured human diploid fibroblasts have a finite lifetime in vitro, and this phenomenon was postulated as cellular aging. Neutral glycosphingolipids (GSLs) from human fetal lung-derived diploid fibroblast cell lines, WI-38 and TIG-1 cells, were studied during cellular aging. Both cell lines had at least four types of neutral GSLs. It was found that neutral GSLs changed with aging, the most conspicuous alteration being a 2-4-fold increase in the content of ceramide monohexoside. This change was invariably observed in either WI-38 or TIG-1 cells.', 'Construction of genetic linkage map is essential for genetic and genomic studies. Recent advances in sequencing and genotyping technologies made it possible to generate high-density and high-resolution genetic linkage maps, especially for the organisms lacking extensive genomic resources. In the present work, we constructed a high-density and high-resolution genetic map for channel catfish with three large resource families genotyped using the catfish 250K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A total of 54,342 SNPs were placed on the linkage map, which to our knowledge had the highest marker density among aquaculture species. The estimated genetic size was 3,505.4 cM with a resolution of 0.22 cM for sex-averaged genetic map. The sex-specific linkage maps spanned a total of 4,495.1 cM in females and 2,593.7 cM in males, presenting a ratio of 1.7 : 1 between female and male in recombination fraction. After integration with the previously established physical map, over 87% of physical map contigs were anchored to the linkage groups that covered a physical length of 867 Mb, accounting for ∼90% of the catfish genome.

However, considerable numbers of cancer cells, especially some highly malignant tumors, are resistant to apoptosis induction by TRAIL, and some cancer cells that were originally sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis can become resistant after repeated exposure (acquired resistance). Understanding the mechanisms underlying such resistance and developing strategies to overcome it are important for the successful use of TRAIL for cancer therapy. Resistance to TRAIL can occur at different points in the signaling pathways of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Dysfunctions of the death receptors DR4 and DR5 due to mutations can lead to resistance. The adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8 are essential for assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex, and defects in either of these molecules can lead to TRAIL resistance. Overexpression of cellular FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (cFLIP) correlates with TRAIL resistance in several types of cancer. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, loss of Bax or Bak function, high expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and reduced release of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac/Diablo) from the mitochondria to the cytosol have all been reported to result in TRAIL resistance in mitochondria-dependent type II cancer cells. Finally, activation of different subunits of mitogen-activated protein kinases or nuclear factor-kappa B can lead to development of either TRAIL resistance or apoptosis in certain types of cancer cells.', 'PURPOSE ::: To evaluate the effects of hematopoietic growth factors on magnetic resonance (MR) image signal intensity (SI) of bone marrow in children undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for musculoskeletal malignancies. ::: ::: ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS ::: Blinded evaluations were performed of T1-weighted and short inversion time inversion recovery images of the pelvis and/or lower extremities of 15 patients undergoing chemotherapy, with or without granulocyte or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Four of the 11 patients who received growth factors initially had hematopoietic marrow SI that did not change during therapy. All seven with initially fatty marrow had SI changes consistent with reconversion to hematopoietic marrow that coincided temporally with increases in absolute neutrophil counts from minimums of 0-2,580/mm3 to maximums of 10,858-45,880/mm3. The four patients who did not receive growth factors had no MR imaging changes in initially hematopoietic (n = 1) or fatty (n = 3) marrow. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Hematopoietic activity induced by growth factors can produce changes in bone marrow SI that may simulate bone marrow involvement by musculoskeletal tumors.', 'Abstract The cuticles of Tenebrio molitor contain a high percentage of apolar amino-acids and lack cystine and methionine. Larval and pupal cuticles from the pronotum and dorsal and ventral abdomen were indistinguishable. Adult cuticles from the pronotum and ventral abdomen were also similar but differed from the cuticles of the adult dorsal abdomen by having a higher percentage of apolar amino-acids. Glycine was the predominant adult cuticular amino-acid, alanine was the major larval and pupal constituent. Cuticles from second pupae produced by animals treated with juvenile hormone were indistinguishable from normal pupal cuticles, but there were differences between these cuticles and the pupal-like cuticles from animals which had been treated with actinomycin D. We have tried to correlate these data with the structure of the cuticles, and with the action of juvenile hormone and its mimics.', 'Differentiation therapy is an attractive option for the treatment of superficial, localized neoplastic lesions of the skin. Topical application of agents that induce differentiation could selectively inhibit tumor cell growth, inducing a program of cell death with the production of cross-linked protein envelopes as the terminal event of this process at the skin surface, effectively eliminating the neoplastic phenotype. The nonspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine induces cornified envelope assembly in neoplastic keratinocytes and causes tumor regression (A. A. Dlugosz and S. H. Yuspa, Cancer Res., 51: 4677-4684, 1991). In pursuit of less toxic agents, specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors were tested for the ability to induce differentiation in keratinocyte-derived cells. Of a range of inhibitors tested, only MC was able to induce cross-linked protein and consequent cell death in mouse and human primary normal keratinocytes, 308 neoplastic mouse keratinocytes, HPV-18-infected immortalized human keratinocytes, and human lines SQCC-Y1 (squamous carcinoma) and A431 (epidermoid carcinoma). MC increased cross-linked protein in a dose-dependent manner (0.05-1 mM). To confirm differentiation, MC-treated mouse primary normal keratinocytes were tested for activation of the endogenous cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase, but no association was found between transglutaminase activity and MC-induced protein cross-linking. MC also induced protein cross-linking in the fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 and in B16 melanoma cells, in which cornified envelope assembly is not part of the differentiation process. This cross-linking occurred at 4 degrees C, suggesting a nonphysiological process. Western blot analysis of an in vitro assay with purified EGF receptor showed that MC was able to cross-link the receptor. As in NIH3T3 cells, DTT inhibited cross-linking, suggesting that oxidation of MC or an acceptor group may be required for this effect. Thus, MC does not induce differentiation by a physiological mechanism in epithelial cells but causes chemical protein cross-linking into cornified envelope-like structures at high concentration.', 'A refolding strategy was described for on-column refolding of recombinant human interferon-γ (rhIFN-γ) inclusion bodies by ion-exchange chromatography (IEC). The rhIFN-γ was expressed in E. colias inclusion bodies. Triton X-100 was used first to wash the rhIFN-γ inclusion bodies before chromatographic refolding. The refolding process was performed by gradually decreasing the concentration of urea in the column after the denatured rhIFN-γ protein had bound onto the ion-exchange gel SP-Sepharose Fast Flow. The refolding and purification process for the denatured rhIFN-γ was carried through simultaneously and the purity of the refolded rhIFN-γ was up to 95%. The effects of protein loading, flow rate, urea gradient length and final urea concentration on the refolding were investigated in detail. Under the optimum conditions, the specific activity of rhIFN-γ was up to 7.5 × 105 IU mg−1and active protein recovery was up to 54%.', 'This paper describes our work in developing a bilingual speech recognition system using two SpeechDat databases. The bilingual aspect of this work is of particular importance in the Galician region of Spain where both languages Galician and Spanish coexist and one of the languages, the Galician one, is a minority language. Based on a global Spanish-Galician phoneme set we built a bilingual speech recognition system which can handle both languages: Spanish and Galician. The recognizer makes use of context dependent acoustic models based on continuous density hidden Markov models. The system has been evaluated on a isolated-word large-vocabulary task. The tests show that Spanish system exhibits a better performance than the Galician system due to its better training. The bilingual system provides an equivalent performance to that achieved by the language specific systems.']\n",

      "[\"Abstract This paper describes two ways of improving Burt and Adelson's Laplacian pyramid, a technique developed for image compression. The Laplacian pyramid is a multi-resolution image representation that captures the loss of information occuring through repeated reduction of the spatial resolution. The generation of this data structure involves the use of two complementary functions: EXPAND, which increases the size of an image by a factor of 2, and REDUCE, which performs the reverse operation. The first modification is the adjunction of a pre-filter to the initial EXPAND function in order to guarantee an image extrapolation that is an exact interpolation of the coarser resolution level. The second refinement is a REDUCE operation modified to minimize information loss. The corresponding least squares Laplacian pyramid (LSLP) is generated by adding a post-filter to the initial REDUCE function. These new functions have an efficient implementation using recursive algorithms. Preliminary experiments indicate improved performance: for a Gaussian-like kernel ( a= 3 8 ), the new EXPAND function exhibits a 2 to 2.5 dB attenuation of the first level of the Laplacian pyramid, while the complete scheme (LSLP)_leads to a 4.7 to 8.5 dB improvement in the two images used to test the procedure. For comparable compression ratios, the subjective image quality for the LSLP appears to be significantly better. A theoretical relationship between the present approach and the family of quadrature mirror filter image pyramids is also derived.\", 'By using cone theorem and monotone iterative method, the mixed monotone condition in A(x,y)+Mx in Banach spaces is extended.The traditional mixed monotonicity is replaced by A(x,y)+Tx.Then the existence of solutions for a kind of nonmonotonic operator equation is given and the initial value problems for impulsive differential equations are discussed.', 'This chapter discusses the extraction of the reconstruction, identification, and trigger efficiencies for prompt photons. The reconstruction efficiency is evaluated using Monte Carlo samples. The identification efficiency is evaluated for reconstructed photons using Monte Carlo samples modified by the observed differences with data. A data-driven method, using electrons from W decays, is also discussed. The trigger efficiency is estimated using collision data with a boot-strap method, using a series of triggers with different thresholds. Finally, the systematic uncertainties affecting the efficiency measurements are estimated.', 'The problem of nonparametric stationary distribution function estimation by the observations of an ergodic diffusion process is considered. The local asymptotic minimax lower bound on the risk of all the estimators is found and it is proved that the empirical distribution function is asymptotically efficient in the sense of this bound.', 'Abstract The paper investigates applications of the root-locus (RL) method to analysis and design of closed loop systems with arbitrary loop transfer functions. Novel analytic sketching rules have been derived first. These rules are applicable to a wide range of transfer functions: rational, fractional and non-rational ones in general, those with time-delays incorporated at various locations, as well as transfer functions describing distributed-parameter systems. An original, straightforward numerical procedure for plotting the root locus has been proposed next. By means of the derived techniques, a generalization of the pole-placement method, which is applicable to control design of both rational and non-rational processes has been proposed also. Finally, it has been shown that RL technique can be very effectively used to investigate the influence of open loop dead-time variations to closed loop poles. It is of particular interest to stress that the techniques proposed and analyzed in this work are exact, in the sense that no rational approximations of infinite-dimensional systems have been utilized.

The method is widely independent of system order and parameter-excitation intensity. The accuracy follows from the stability problem exactly solved—in the numerical sense—by the Floquet integration controlled by an independent global error calculation, while the direct computation of the limits themself is responsible for a minimum of process time. The application of the approach and some results including nonordinary phenomena will be shown with several multicylinder torsional crankshaft models in Part II, paying due attention to procedural and system properties.', 'This paper adds a new dimension to the study of obligatory control: the distinction of inherent vs. non-inherent control predicates. Inherent control predicates are clause-embedding predicates that invariantly require identification of one of its individual arguments with an argument of the embedded predicate, irrespective of the type of clausal complement. The paper thus identifies instances of control in German finite verb-final and V2 complements and in nominalized clausal arguments, thereby adding data to the discussion of finite control. The lexical property of inherent control results from various factors: one major factor is event coherence -the respective predicates and their clausal complements denote a coherent event, which disallows incompatible local and temporal modifiers in matrix clause and embedded clause (e.g. with implicative verbs such as wagen \\'dare\\'). As a consequence, matrix predicate and embedded predicate have to share at least one participant. In addition, there are various subgroups of inherent control predicates that do not exhibit event coherence. Here, the inherence of the control relation results a) from the sincerity conditions of the matrix predicates (with directive and commissive predicates), b) the fact that the clausal argument is integrated as \"direct predication\" of the matrix predicate\\'s internal argument (e.g. vorwerfen \\'reproach\\'), or c) semantic specialization of the matrix predicate in contrast to semantically similar predicates, which involves self-related attitudes or speech acts (e.g. bereuen \\'regret/repent\\').', 'We give a characterization of minimal triangulation of graphs using the notion of \"maximal set of neighbor separators\". We prove that if all the maximal sets of neighbor separators of some graphs can be computed in polynomial time, the treewidth of those graphs can be computed in polynomial time.

However, production of meat originating from dairy herds has been shown to be economically more profitable and to produce less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of product than beef production from suckler cow systems. Therefore, when safeguarding beef self-sufficiency, the intensification of beef production from dairy herds is a more promising option to consider. In this study, the possibility of different options for increasing dairy beef production was assessed by using a deterministic simulation. Increasing the use of crossbreeding in dairy herds, especially when combined with the use of Y-sorted semen, appeared to be the most efficient strategy for increasing dairy beef production.

NAA, IBA (0, 60, 120, 180, 240 ppm) and IAA hormones (0, 100, 200, 300, 400 ppm) were prepared by dissolving in distilled water. Stem cuttings were kept in hormone solution for 24 hours and they were planted in perlit medium under greenhouse conditions. After a month, the number of rooted stem cutting, the number of root per stem cuttings, root length and root weight were determined on stem cuttings. Rooting was observed in all of the cuttings for both samples to which hormone was applied and to which hormone was not applied. According to the result of the variance analysis, the effects of the hormones and hormone doses on the examined characters were found significant as statistically. According to the results obtained, IAA application increased root number considerably. While high hormone dose applications caused the notable increase in root weight and root number in all of three hormones, low hormone applications did not affect root length.', 'Abstract Phytoplankton and macrophytes are the main primary producers in shallow lakes, and lake eutrophication can induce excessive increases in producer productivity and biomass. To create an ecological index, the equivalent chlorophyll a (EC-a) content of phytoplankton and macrophytes was calculated with an uniformisation model of the phytoplankton chlorophyll a and macrophyte biomass, which is very important to analyse the potential trophic state of the ecosystem in shallow lakes. There was competitive balance between phytoplankton and macrophytes in some shallow lakes of Jiangsu province, China. The EC-a did not significantly correlate with trophic state indicators such as the transparency, total phosphorus, total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand in the studied lakes. No significant correlation appeared between the EC-a and TSI in the three lake groups investigated. The traditional assessment of the trophic state only utilised the biomass of phytoplankton and excluded the biomass of macrophytes in the water column. Thus, the EC-a index is better suited to characterise the potential trophic state of shallow lakes considering the potential impact of macrophytes.', 'Over 300,000 Chinese students are studying in the U.S., making China the top country of international origin with 31.2 percent of all U.S. international students (IIE, 2015). In addition, 2015 saw a 10 percent increase in international students in the U.S., a statistic that underscores the assumption that globally mobile students regard the U.S. as a destination of choice (IIE, 2015). In the fall of 2015, 1,758 Chinese students were studying at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) (University of Pittsburgh Fact Book, 2016). ::: The number of Chinese alumni will increase as these matriculated students graduate from U.S. universities. However, Chinese alumni university philanthropy has lagged behind domestic and international alumni philanthropy (Zi, 2014). The need for private philanthropy is clear. Higher education in the United States is in a financial crisis. Decreased funding from state and federal governments combined with rising costs have led higher education institutions to enhance efforts to raise funds from private philanthropic sources (Pew Charitable Trust, 2015). ::: In order to develop a philanthropic relationship between Chinese students and their U.S. host institutions, it is necessary to understand their student experience. Very little is known about this population by university departments that regularly interact with Chinese students, including the Office of International Services (OIS) at Pitt. OIS works closely with all international students during their tenure at university and is responsible for securing a student’s Optional Practical Training (OPT) following graduation. Institutional Advancement (IA), the fundraising arm of a university, also has a vested interest in better understanding Chinese students. ::: This study employs a mixed-methods research design that employs a survey with Likert-style and open-ended responses. It asks Pitt’s Chinese alumni about their experiences as undergraduate or graduate students. The findings may help universities better serve Chinese students and develop strong alumni ties. The two key findings from this study found that predictors of Chinese students’ overall satisfaction and thus future engagement potential were (1) tied to students’ ability to gain work or career building skills through their classes, a university teaching experience, and/or internships, and (2) students’ satisfaction with their interaction with OIS is tied to the amount of time allocated to their appointments.', 'This study analyzed the spatio-temporal patterns of 4,587 (94% of the total) confirmed dengue cases in Kaohsiung and Fengshan Cities (a two-city area) that occurred in Taiwan from 2001 to 2003. The epidemic had two simultaneous distinct diffusion patterns. One was a contiguous pattern, mostly limited to 1 km from an initial cluster, reflecting that there was a rapid dispersal of infected Aedes aegypti and viremic persons. The second followed a relocation pattern, involving clusters of cases that diffused over 10 weeks starting from the southern and moving to the northern parts of the two-city area. The virus from one clustering site jumped to several distant areas where it rapidly dispersed through a series of human-mosquito transmission cycles to several localities. In both patterns, transmission of disease quickly enlarged the epidemic areas. Future dengue control efforts would benefit from a timely syndromic surveillance system plus extensive public education on how to avoid further transmission.', 'Abstract Two flavonol glycosides, quercetin galactoside and quercetin arabinoside, have been identified in American cranberry fruit, as a complementary investigation of our previous study. The analysis processes included separation, hydrolysis and structure elucidation of flavonol glycosides. The separation of flavonol glycosides was carried out by solvent extraction, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After hydrolysis of the obtained flavonol glycosides, flavonol aglycones and sugars were identified by HPLC and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), respectively.', 'This study, investigated the effects of radiation on weight change in rabbit following consumption of diets mixed with fresh and thermoxidised palm oil, common diets among the people in the tropics. Two groups of rabbits each were fed with normal diets (Control group 1), Fresh palm oil diets (FPOD) and thermoxidised palm oil diets (TPOD), respectively, while one batch of each group (Control group 2R, FPOD 2R and TPOD 2R, respectively) were subjected to X-irradiation. Weights of the experimental animals were taken over 12 weeks of feeding, followed by another ten weeks after a break of seven weeks to allow for recovery of the animals. Results showed that FPOD diets produced a weight enhancement effect on the animals, with 14.86% weight increase in 12 weeks of feeding against 13.05% for the control group 1 animals. This reduced after X-irradiation to a weight gain of 8.85% for the control group 2R and 7.08% for the FPOD 2R group. TPOD groups showed poorer weight response at -3.75% for the group 1 and -3.32% for the irradiated group 2R. Repeating the experiments after the rest period showed the same pattern of results but at slightly lower values.

Compounds to be studied are carbon tetrachloride (CT) and the chlorinated ethenes, tetrachloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE) cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE), and vinyl chloride (VC). The chlorinated solvents often are present as dense non-aqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs), which are difficult to remove. Biodegradation of DNAPLs was previously thought not possible because of toxicity, but recent evidence indicates that under the right conditions, biodegradation is possible. Anaerobic biodegradation of DNAPLs is the major subject of this research. The specific objectives of this multi-investigator effort are: (1) Evaluate the potential for chlorinated solvent biodegradation near DNAPLs, (2) Provide a molecular understanding of the biological mechanisms involved, (3) Determine cellular components involved in carbon tetrachloride transformation by Pseudomonas stutzeri strain KC without chloroform formation.', 'Normally, cylinder pressure was used as a criterion of combustion occurrence, ::: while in some conditions, it may be unreliable when identifying lean mixture ::: combustion.

This study aims to develop an empirical UCS estimating formula for grouted sand based on the physical properties of sands and the UCS of cured pure grout. Four sands with varying particle sizes were grouted with both microfine cement and Ordinary Portland cement. Grouted specimens were prepared at three different relative densities and at three different water-to-cement ratios, and unconfined compression tests were performed. The results demonstrate that UCS of grouted sand can be expressed as the power function of the UCS of cured pure grout: UCSgrouted sand / 1 MPa = Asoil x (UCSpure / 1 MPa)N. Because the exponent N strongly depends on the combination of pore area and pore size, N is expressed as the function of porosity (n) and specific surface (Sa). Additionally, because Sa determines the area of the sand particle that cement particles can adsorb and n determines the number of cementation bondings between sand particles, Asoil is also expressed as the function of n and Sa. Finally, the direct relationship between Asoil and N is also investigated.', 'Abstract This paper describes a study of the dispersion of hydroxyapatite (OHAp) powder in aqueous media. The slurry stability is achieved by utilizing a combination of a commercially available dispersant, polyacrylic acid sodium salt (PAA-Na) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, tetrasodium salt, dihydrate (EDTA·4Na·2H 2 O). Adsorption, sedimentation and rheology measurements have been performed to investigate the suspensions properties. It was shown that HAp slurries could be stabilized at pH 10.50 with the PAA-Na concentration around 0.45 wt%. Rheological measurement confirmed that well dispersed slurries could be obtained with the solid content as high as 63 vol%. After sintering, the relative density of HAp sheets reached 98.8%. The as sintered HAp samples exhibited excellent properties for cell attachment and proliferation. Results showed that the aqueous processing technique is effective for preparation HAp samples for biological applications.', 'This study investigated the effects of solvents’ polarities on the geometry and electronic properties of 2-(2-nitrovinyl) furan, (NVF). The investigation was carried via theoretical approach, using an ab-initio [Hartree Fock (HF/6-31G*)] and Density Functional Theory (DFT/B3LYP/6-31G*).The properties investigated are optimized structures, energy gaps (ELUMO – EHOMO) and associated global properties, chemical potential (ƙ), global hardness (η), ionization energy (IE), Electron affinity (EA), dipole moment (μ), polarizability (α) and electronic charges. NVF was sparingly soluble in water, very soluble and more active in polar organic solvent than non-polar solvents. The solvent polarities do not change the structural parameters of NVF widely, but have significant changes on the electron density re-distribution. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the molecule showed π-characters, an indication of intermolecular charge transfer characteristics for the excitation of electrons in NVF. The change in the dipole moment associated with low energy gaps for NVF in the polar solvent showed that NVF has strong activity in the solvents. The theoretical data obtained in this study are in good agreement with the earlier reported experimental data.', 'This paper gives a comprehensive study on the modeling and design challenges of Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) in high speed three-dimensional (3D) system integration. To investigate the propagation characteristics incurred by operations within the ultra-broad band frequency range, we propose an equivalent circuit model which accounts for rough sidewall effect and high frequency effect. A closed-form expression for TSV metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) capacitance in both depletion and accumulation regions is proposed. The coupling of TSV arrays and near and far field effect on crosstalk analysis are performed using 3D Electro-Magnetic (EM) field solver. Based on the TSV circuit model, we optimize the TSVs’ architecture and manufacturing process parameters and develop effective design guidelines for TSVs, which could be used to resolve the signal integrity issues arising at high frequency data transmission in 3D Integrated Circuits (ICs).', 'The course in time of ion concentration and field strength in a spark channel has been determined with the aid of time-resolved spectra. Using experimentally determined wavelength shifts of spectral lines, the field strength and ion concentrations are calculated from equations derived by Unsold and Holtsmark. In the spark channels of Mg, Zn, Cd and Hg, the highest field strength observed was about 600 kVcm for an ion concentration of about 1018 ioncm3. Using time-resolved spectra, the variation in time of field strength and ion concentration was observed. Maximum line shifts occur during the initial stages of each discharge, indicating that field strengths, ion concentrations, and Stark effect are at a maximum. With the passage of time the temperature of the spark channel decreases, as well as the field strength and ion concentration. Normal wavelengths are observed after the field strength has decreased below a certain limit.']\n",

However, GA obtains solution by overlaying generations because of being based on evolution in organic. Thus, it takes a long time to find approximate solution. While, Virus Theory of Evolution (VTE) can evolve by virus infection. VTE characteristic has sharing of information among same generation. If new algorithm is using both these characteristics of GA and VTE, convergence speed would be faster than GA. Thus, this study proposes Genetic Algorithm with Virus Infection (GAVI).

Current implementations of quantum cryptography are based on the BB84 protocol, which is susceptible to siphoning attacks on the multiple photons emitted by practical laser sources. This makes BB84-based quantum cryptography protocol unsuitable for network computing environments. Diffie-Hellman does not require the two parties to be mutually authenticated to each other, yet it can provide a basis for a number of authenticated protocols, most notably the concept of perfect forward secrecy. The work proposed in this paper provides a new direction in utilizing quantum EPR pairs in quantum key exchange. Although, classical cryptography boasts of efficient and robust protocols like the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, in the current times, with the advent of quantum computing they are very much vulnerable to eavesdropping and cryptanalytic attacks. Using quantum cryptographic principles, however, these classical encryption algorithms show more promise and a more robust and secure structure for applications. The unique properties of quantum EPR pairs also, on the other hand, go a long way in removing attacks like eavesdropping by their inherent nature of one particle of the pair losing its state if a measurement occurs on the other. The concept of perfect forward secrecy is revisited in this paper to attribute tighter security to the proposed protocol.', 'Abstract Projections made by credible institutions indicate that coal will continue to provide a major fraction of the global electricity mix for many decades to come. Assuming the validity of these projections and building on this likely scenario, this perspective article proposes oxygen-based coal conversion as a sustainable pathway for zero-carbon power generation, albeit not without its own challenges. The century-old tradition of burning coal in air is no longer sustainable. Achieving zero-carbon coal power dictates full capture of CO2 emissions. Unfortunately, renewable power is still far from fully displacing coal-based power despite major gains. Also, renewables are inherently non-dispatchable sources constrained severely by lack of utility-scale electricity storage. Moreover, prospects for total conversion of power generation to natural gas presents its own challenges due to uncertain impacts of hydraulic fracturing on the environment. It is highly likely that we will need both coal and natural gas for electricity production. Accordingly, this article proposes a roadmap that emphasizes rapid transitioning of coal-based (and natural gas-based) power generation from air-based combustion to oxygen-based conversion. The latter excludes nitrogen from entering the process stream and offers easy capture of CO2 to achieve zero-carbon electricity generation with significant savings on water demand.', 'The bioluminescent-bioreporter integrated circuit represents a new advance in the development of whole-cell biosensors, consisting of a genetically engineered bioreporter organism interfaced with an integrated circuit. The bioreporter is engineered to luminesce when a targeted substance is encountered, with the circuit being designed to detect this luminescence, process the signal and communicate the results. The bioreporters are thus available to the circuit designer as another component, analogous to a transistor or a resistor, albeit a living entity. The concept has been demonstrated using Pseudomonas putida TVA8 to sense the environmental pollutant toluene.', 'The formalism of Quantum Mechanics is based by definition on conserving probabilities and thus there is no room for the description of dissipative systems in Quantum Mechanics. The treatment of time-irreversible evolution (the arrow of time) is therefore ruled out by definition in Quantum Mechanics. In Quantum Field Theory it is, however, possible to describe time-irreversible evolution by resorting to the existence of infinitely many unitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations (ccr). In this paper I review such a result by discussing the canonical quantization of the damped harmonic oscillator (dho), a prototype of dissipative systems. The irreversibility of time evolution is expressed as tunneling among the unitarily inequivalent representations. Canonical quantization is shown to lead to time dependent SU(1,1) coherent states. The exact action for the dho is derived in the the path integral formalism of the quantum Brownian motion developed by Schwinger and by Feynman and Vernon. The doubling of the phase-space degrees of freedom for dissipative systems is related to quantum noise effects. Finally, the role of dissipation in the quantum model of the brain and the occurrence that the cosmological arrow of time, the thermodynamical one and the biological one point into the same direction are shortly mentioned.', 'Advances in arrival scheduling and controller aids for spacing have potential benefits of reducing aircraft delays and increasing airport arrival throughput. Schedulers use fixed arrival paths to estimate aircraft time-to-fly and assign them arrival slots based on the required separation plus a buffer. Concepts that reduce arrival time uncertainty can take advantage of advanced scheduling with smaller spacing buffers. These concepts have been successfully demonstrated with a handful of near to mid-term traffic demand scenarios and technologies using spacing buffers as low as 0.3 nmi. The analysis published here characterizes the observed arrival spacing behavior of 29 runways belonging to 15 airports within 8 of the busiest terminal areas across the United States for 32–60 days worth of traffic. The typical observed instrument arrival buffers ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 nmi would equate to roughly 10–20% increase in runway arrival capacity if buffers were reduced to 0.3 nmi. The effect of fixed arrival routing on terminal area flight time was also studied. Most runways studied had significant path stretch delay. This work estimates that 1–2 min of this delay could be reduced with precision scheduling and most of the remainder could be absorbed by speed control.', 'To improve the solving efficiency and performance,a new Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization(DPSO) algorithm for the problem of weapon-target assignment(WTA) was presented,in which the velocity and position in the original PSO formulas were redefined to solve a discrete combination optimization such as WTA.The greedy heuristic policies were exploited to adjust the solutions generated during the execution of the algorithm to find optimal or suboptimal solution rapidly.The experiments show that the new algorithm can get the optimal or suboptimal solution quickly,and the result is satisfying.']\n",

Diabetes is an important chronic health problem associated with insulin resistance, increased insulin level, changes in growth hormones and factors, and activation of mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, leading to an increased breast cancer risk. This paper looked at the epidemiologic studies of the association between type 2 diabetes and risk of breast cancer and its effect on overall cancer-specific survival. The combined evidence overall supported a modest association between type 2 diabetes and the risk of breast cancer, which was found to be more prevalent among postmenopausal women. Effect of oral diabetics and insulin therapy on breast cancer risk was also evaluated. It was found that metformin and thiazolidinones tended to have a protective role. Metformin therapy trials for its use as an adjuvant for breast cancer treatment are still ongoing. Sulfonylurea and insulin therapy were found to be mildly associated with increased overall cancers. No evidence or studies evaluated the association of DPPIV inhibitors and GLP 1 agonists with breast cancer risk because of their recent introduction into the management of diabetes.', \"Breastfeeding has numerous health benefits; however, many mothers do not continue breastfeeding to the recommended 6 months of age.

Therefore, this study was conducted with aim to assess the appropriate cut-off point in glucose challenge test in pregnant women. Methods: In this study, data of Iranian pregnant women without diabetes referring to Rafsanjan gynecology clinics for assessment of gestational diabetes were collected. GCT was performed for the women in 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test was performed for women who their test result was â�¥135 mg/dl and â�¤200 mg/dl. The OGTT results were interpreted by Carpenter and Coustan criteria. Finally, the appropriate cut-off point of GCT was calculated by SPSS software (version 22) and the ROC curve. Results: The results of GCT showed that the maximum and minimum values of GCT were 93 and 199 mg/dl respectively, with meanÂ±SD of 161.99Â±15.83 mg/dl. 235 cases of pregnant women had positive GTT test. According to the ROC curves for all study population, GTT cut-off point was 140 mg/dl with 97 sensitivity, in low-risk group for gestational diabetes was 147 mg/dl with 96 sensitivity and for high risk group was 135 mg/dl with 100 sensitivity and had the most predictive value. Conclusion: Suitable cut-off point in GCT for gestational diabetes is different in low and high risk pregnant women. Depending on the presence or absence of risk factors in mothers, we can reduce or increase the cut-off point of the GCT.', 'Changes in the hepatic drug/xenobiotic‐metabolizing enzymes in underfed rats exposed to aflatoxin B1 and N‐acetylaminofluorene were investigated.

Significantly low activities of UDP‐glucuronyltransferase and glutathione S‐transferase were observed in food‐restricted animals fed on aflatoxin B1. N‐acetylaminofluorene, on the other hand stimulated both the enzyme activities in the underfed group, to as much observed in the respective well‐fed treated group. UDP‐Glucuronyltransferase and glutathione S‐transferase in undernutrition seem to respond differently to aflatoxin B1 and N‐acetylaminofluorene. Further studies are needed to assess the possible consequences of such alterations.', \"There existed a custom in Ireland regarding the religious affiliation of the children of mixed marriages: the sons would follow the religion of their father and the daughters that of their mother. This custom, whilst it is impossible to determine how widespread it was, certainly existed in the popular consciousness throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It offered a compromise, as it still does today. It removes the existential threat posed by mixed marriage, in the case of all the children following one parent's religion. It pragmatically allows the perpetuation of two belief systems, one through the male line and one through the female line.\"]\n",

      "['Observational evidence for the existence of a chromosphere on the cool magnetic white dwarf GD 356 has been reported. In addition, there have been theoretical speculations that cool magnetic white dwarfs may be sources of coronal X-ray emission. This emission, if it exists, would be distinct from the two types of X-ray emission (deep photospheric and shocked wind) that have already been observed from hot white dwarfs. We have used the PSPC instrument on ROSAT to observe three of the most prominent DA white dwarf candidates for coronal X-ray emission: GD 356, KUV 2316+123, and GD 90. The data show no significant emission for these stars. The derived upper limits for the X-ray luminosities provide constraints for a revision of current theories of the generation of nonradiative energy in white dwarfs.', 'We present the discovery of a weak radio galaxy from the Leiden Berkeley Deep Survey at a redshift of 2.390, the faint optical and IR counterpart of the steep-spectrum, compact radio source 53W002. Its lambda-dependent optical continuum morphology is compact with linear size approximately 10-35 kpc (H0 = 50, q0 = 0). In redshifted Ly-alpha, the galaxy is somewhat more extended (less-than-or-similar-to 67 kpc x 40 kpc). Its radio source is 7 times smaller than, and confined by, the Ly-alpha gas. It shows alignment with the Ly-alpha gas and the best seeing optical continuum images. We present nine-band photometry (Ly-alpha U BgriJHK) for the galaxy as well as surrounding objects. The source 53W002 is not variable on time scales of years, in either radio or optical. We compare its rest-frame UV continuum with IUE spectra of various nearby galaxies with relatively recent starbursts, and nearby active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The C IV/Ly-alpha and N v/Ly-alpha ratios suggest that 53W002 has a Seyfert 1-like AGN, and constrain the nonthermal component to be approximately 35% of the observed UV continuum. Several independent age estimates yield a consistent value of 0.25-0.32 Gyr: (1) its small 4000 angstrom break or UV-visual continuum amplitude compared with nearby galaxies; (2) a best model fit to the downturn of its UV spectrum below approximately 2000 angstrom; (3) limits from the lack of detected stellar absorption features; (4) its total stellar mass (from its V- and K-band luminosity) compared with its SFR [from W-lambda (Ly-alpha, z = 0)]. These parameters together suggest that at z = 2.390, 53W002 had processed only a few times 10(11) M. into stars, significantly less than most powerful radio galaxies have converted into stars at z approximately 2-3.8. Hence, star formation in 53W002 has proceeded slower, and started at a later epoch, than in the most powerful high-redshift radio galaxies. The available data are consistent with 53W002 being a genuinely young (radio) galaxy seen at z = 2.390 during its first major starburst. It likely started forming most of its current stars at redshifts 2.5-3.0 (for H0 = 50-100, q0 = 0.0-0.5). This suggests that (radio) galaxies do not form the bulk of their stars coevally, but start doing so over a wide range of cosmic time.', 'Excluding those unsettled systems undergoing mergers, bright galaxies come in two flavours: with and without discs. In this work we look for photometric evidence for presence of discs and compare it with kinematic results of the ATLAS 3D survey (Cappellari et al . 2011). We fit a Sersic (1968) function to azimuthally averaged light profiles of ATLAS 3D galaxies to derive single component fits and, subsequently, we fit a combination of the Sersic function (free index n ) and an exponential function ( n =1) with the purpose of decomposing the light profiles into “bulge” and “disc” components (B+D model) of all non-barred sample galaxies. We compare the residuals of the B+D models with those of the single Sersic fits and select the B+D model as preferred only when the improvement is substantial and there are no correlations within residuals. We find that the high angular momentum objects (fast rotators) are disc dominated systems with bulges of typically low n (when their light profiles can be decomposed) or are best represented with a single Sersic function with a low Sersic index ( n', 'The near-contact binary IR Cas was observed in 2003 October. Two new observed times of the primary minimum were derived. All of the available eclipse times, including the new ones, spanning 90 years were analyzed. It was shown that the period change of the system is very complex. A period oscillation with a period of 53.24 years and an amplitude of about 0.0133 days were found, while it undergoes a secular decrease at a rate of dP/dt = -1.18 x 10(-7)(+/- 0.09)dyr(-1). The mechanisms that could explain the period changes and the evolutionary state of the system are discussed.', 'Since the detection of non-thermal radio emission from the bow shock of the massive runaway star BD +43$^{\\\\circ}$3654 simple models have predicted high-energy emission, at X and gamma-rays, from these Galactic sources. Observational searches for this emission so far give no conclusive evidence but a few candidates at gamma rays. In this work we aim at developing a more sophisticated model for the non-thermal emission from massive runaway star bow shocks. The main goal is to establish whether these systems are efficient non-thermal emitters, even if they are not strong enough to be yet detected. For modeling the collision between the stellar wind and the interstellar medium we use 2D hydrodynamic simulations. We then adopt the flow profile of the wind and the ambient medium obtained with the simulation as the plasma state for solving the transport of energetic particles injected in the system, and the non-thermal emission they produce. For this purpose we solve a 3D (2 spatial + energy) advection-diffusion equation in the test-particle approximation. We find that a massive runaway star with a powerful wind converts 0.16-0.4% of the power injected in electrons into non-thermal emission, mostly produced by inverse Compton scattering of dust-emitted photons by relativistic electrons, and secondly by synchrotron radiation. This represents a fraction of $\\\\sim$ $10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ of the wind kinetic power. Given the better sensibility of current instruments at radio wavelengths theses systems are more prone to be detected at radio through the synchrotron emission they produce rather than at gamma energies.', 'The atomic or “kinetic” theory of gases, with its interpretations of such qualities as temperature, pressure, viscosity and conductivity, has ranked for more than half a century as a very important part of theoretical physics. A corresponding theory for radiation and for negative electricity is much to be desired, since it is known that in many ways each of these entities behaves as though it were atomic. There are, however, differences among the three, and only within the last five years have these been formulated suitably. This article is devoted to the resulting statistical theories.', 'Abstract A resonance is observed in the 27 Al(p, γ) 28 Si reaction at E p =2876±2 keV, which corresponds to an excitation energy of 14356±2 keV. The 14.36 MeV level decays to a new level at 11577±2 keV, which is turn decays to the known level at 9701.8±0.5 keV. With previous information on the 9.70 MeV level and the present γ-ray angular distributions, obtained from singles spectra as recorded by a 40 cm 3 Ge(Li) detector, the spins of the three levels can be limited to J =5, 6; J =6; and J =5, respectively. Transition strength arguments based on measurements of the strength of the 2876 keV resonance and the lifetime of the 11.58 MeV level indicate that the 14.36 MeV level has J π =6 − , T =1 and that the 11.58 MeV level has J π =6 − , T =0.', 'Photographs (53) from life of mostly Neotropical and tropical Sphingidae, both flying and/or perching, are presented. Discussed and illustrated are 44 species. The larva of one species is illustrated.', 'Project GRAND preents a map in right ascension and declination for single cosmic secondary tracks which have been identified as muons. These muons are measured in stations of proportional wire chambers (PWCs) which have a mean angular resolution of 0.26 deg. A 50 mm steel plate interspersed with the PWCs is used to distinguish muons from electrons. Two years of data are accumulated in a map of right ascension and declination which covers all of the northern hemisphere and a small portion of the southern hemisphere. The total number of muon tracks in this data sample are 40 billion. Significant large angular structure is found in this map; the deviations from average are small compared to the average, but because of the high statistics, the deviations from average are statistically significant to many standard deviations. Systematic effects in the data are minimized by averaging over this two year period. These results are similar to those obtained in previous data.', 'Most of signals in engineering are nonstationary and time-varying. The Fourier transform as a traditional approach can only provide the feature information in frequency domain. The time-frequency techniques may give a comprehensive description of signals in time-frequency planes. Based on some typical nonstationary signals, five time-frequency analysis methods, i.e., the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), wavelet transform (WT), Wigner- Ville distribution (WVD), pseudo-WVD (PWVD) and the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), were performed and compared in this paper. The characteristics of each method were obtained and discussed. Compared with the other methods, the HHT with a high time-frequency resolution can clearly describe the rules of the frequency compositions changing with time, is a good approach for feature extraction in nonstationary signal processing.']\n",
